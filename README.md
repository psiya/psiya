## About Me
I am a sophomore double majoring in Computer Science B.S. and Data Science B.A. with a minor in Neuroscience at UNC Chapel Hill. I am currently a part of the Education Team for the CS + Social Good club here at UNC. I love learning about different areas of computer science to see what I enjoy doing. I am interested in the field of Web and Game Development, and have some beginner experience in making mini games! I love how diverse computer science can be and learning about the different ways we can shape our future!
